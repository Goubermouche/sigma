## Ways to contribute

### Contributing to the compiler implementation
Before contributing to the compiler implementation please read our [**style guide**](STYLE.md) first. Pretty much anything can be a contribution, from a tiny typo fix, to an entire feature implementation - anything is possible. 
Another way of contributing to the compiler implementation is editing and giving suggestions related to the [**compiler design**](COMPILER_DESIGN.md) writeup. 

### Contributing to the language design
Before contributing to the language design implementation please read our [**language design**](LANGUAGE_DESIGN.md) writeup.
